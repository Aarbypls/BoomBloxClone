# Boom Blox Clone Prototype

## Concept

This is a simple clone of an easy level from the video game Boom Blox. The user fires projectiles at a Jenga-like structure in order to topple off individual bricks to score points.

## Controls

The controls for this game are very simple:

- Left Mouse Button: Fire Projectile
- WASD: Move Camera
- Spacebar: Restart Level

## Credits

Everything in this prototype was made with standard Unity assets.
